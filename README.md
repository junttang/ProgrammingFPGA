This repository contains source codes of mine for the course 'Sogang Computer Engineering Experiments II' in the second semester, 2021.

We used the Vivado IDE tool to implement some basic and complex logic functions with Verilog HDL.

**ALERT : If you, the reader is a student who takes the same course and have to do the same assignments, DO NOT COPY this codes. You can refer to the code to help yourself do the homework efficiently, but do not just copying at all.**
